     * on the time until document addition/removals are actually reflected by corresponding query expressions. Once a
     * “commit” operation is complete all documents added/removed prior to the start of the “commit” operation will be
     * reflected by queries invoked in subsequent ArangoDB transactions, in-progress ArangoDB transactions will still
     * continue to return a repeatable-read state.
